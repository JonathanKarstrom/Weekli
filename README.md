## planned functionality

This app will serve as a repository for all of your favorite recipes. You will be able to create your own account and add your favorite recipes. The app will then randomly select your recipes
from the tags you have chosen and create a weekly menu for you with a included shopping list.

## TODOS:

* Very much.
* Add function to add new recipes.
* Fix shopping list loop and make it persistant.
* Rework the layout of the add recipe page.
* Rework main login page.
* Add password confirmation bar to register page.
* Add edit and delete options to your recipe list.
